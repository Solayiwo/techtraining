Brief summary about git.

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system, originally created by 
Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git operates on the principle of creating snapshots or "commits" 
of your code at different stages, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. 
It introduces the concept of a repository, which acts as a central storehouse for all your 
project's files and their revision history. Git command prompt (git bash) serves as a powerful 
tool for navigating your file system, executing commands, and interacting with git.  Git commands 
allow the command prompt facilitates tasks such as cloning repositories, making commits, pushing 
changes to remote servers, pull, merge and resolving conflicts.
